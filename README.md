Spreadsheet your data in AWK

I always wondered why nobody ever made some spreadsheet like app in AWK.
Isn't AWK all about rows and columns and fields?

So I decided to try my hand at it myself and eventually came up with this setup.

Or some Asciinema casts:

It's still very early in the development phase.
